* Other:- Html, Css , typeScript

##  Project Plan for Book Management System (BMS)
### Step 1
* SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle) Steps :-
    * -> Requirements :- Users can add, view, update, and delete books.
    * -> Book fields: Title, Author, ISBN, Publication Date, Genre.
    * -> Admin panel for management.
 
* Designing :-
    * -> Front-End: Form for adding books using (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
    * -> Architecture: Client-server model with 3-tier architecture(View , Controller , Model-Logic part).
    * -> Data Base Management: Books stored in database (table: books)
 
* Implementation :-
    * -> Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript - framework:- Angular
    * -> Backend: Node.js - framework:- Express.js / Loopback4
    * -> Database: SQL
 
* Testing :-
    * -> Manual testing: Add, edit, delete, retrieve books
 
* Deployment :-
    * -> GitHub- Source Code of Project
    * -> AWS - Remote Server for website hosting
 
* Maintenance :-
    * -> Bug fixes 
    * -> Updates and performance improvements
 
### Step 2
* i. Client-Server Model
  
                           HTTP request
        Browser          ----------------->            Server
  (Client - Html Form)   <-----------------   (Backend - Business logic)
                            HTTP response

* 3-Tier Architecture [View - Controller - Service(Model)]
  
  -   Web Browser [ Presentation Layer (HTML/JS) ]
  -   Back-End Server [ Logic Layer (Server-side Code) ]
  -   Database [ Data Layer (PostgreSqll) ]

### Step 3 Basic HTML Page for Book Form
  * Project Repo Link for source code :-
     -  https://github.com/Abhishek-Singh-SFIN1771/BMS-Angular
 
### Step 4 Set Up a GitHub Repository and push source code
  * -> Repo name = Abhishek-Singh-SFIN1771-BMS-Angular
  * -> Push source code
